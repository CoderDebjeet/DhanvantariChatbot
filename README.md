## 🔄 Functional Workflow

1. ### 📝 Symptom Input
   - Users input their symptoms (e.g., "I have cough and sore throat").
   - Input is validated in the Flutter UI and sent to the backend.

2. ### 🔍 Query Preprocessing
   - Input is cleaned and tokenized.
   - Embeddings are generated using **Sentence Transformers** like `all-MiniLM`.

3. ### 🧠 Semantic Search (Pinecone)
   - The embeddings are used to search in the **Pinecone Vector DB**.
   - Relevant Ayurvedic treatments, causes, and herbs are retrieved.

4. ### 🤖 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
   - **RAGChain** merges the user's query with the retrieved context.
   - The combined prompt is sent to an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5, Falcon, Mistral) on **Hugging Face**.
   - The model responds with context-aware Ayurvedic guidance.

5. ### 📤 Response Handling
   - Post-processing is done on the output.
   - The final result is displayed beautifully on the Flutter frontend.
