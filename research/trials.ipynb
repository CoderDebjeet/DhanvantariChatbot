      " Agnis or Digestive Fire is a Sanskrit term used in Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India. It refers to the digestive enzymes present in the body that help break down food into nutrients that can be absorbed and utilized by the body for energy, growth, and repair. Agnis are believed to govern the digestion of food and play a key role in maintaining overall health and preventing disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of Agnis is closely related to the idea of the three dosás or elements (earth, water, and fire) that make up the body's tissue structure. Each tissue system is believed to be governed by one of these elements, with digestion being influenced by the element of fire (agni). Poor digestion can lead to a buildup of toxic substances in the body, which can result in a range of health problems. Agnis are also associated with the idea of dhátus or tissue transformations, which occur as the body breaks down and rebuilds its tissues over time. By promoting healthy digestion and tissue transformation, Agnis are believed to help maintain overall health and well-being.\n"

      " Gem therapy is an holistic approach that uses the vibrational energy of gemstones to balance and heal the body’s physical, mental, and emotional energies. Different gems are associated with specific planets and are believed to have specific healing properties. By wearing or meditating on a particular gem, an individual can tap into its therapeutic qualities and bring balance to their energy field. The use of gem therapy is based on the idea that each gemstone has its own unique vibrational frequency, which can be used to offset negative energy in the body.\n",

      "Answer:  Agnis is a Sanskrit term that refers to the digestive fire or enzymes in the body. There are seven tissue systems or dhátus in the body, each governed by one of the three elements earth, water, and fire. Each dhátu is found in the alimentary canal and digests food. The normal digestion of the three doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) produces Samágni. Digestive activity is essential for good health and prevention of disease.\n",
